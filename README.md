# Mental-Health-Outcomes-in-the-Age-of-Remote-Work
With remote work increasingly viewed as a viable option, especially given the current economic conditions, we aim to use the CRISP-DM (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) methodology to analyze the dataset and identify patterns among features. Techniques such as correlation analysis, regression, and machine learning will be used to uncover these patterns. We hope these findings provide greater insight and draw attention to potential issues associated with remote work, helping to mitigate mental health risks.
