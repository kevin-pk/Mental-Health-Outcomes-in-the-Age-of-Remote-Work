# Mental-Health-Outcomes-in-the-Age-of-Remote-Work

The goal of this project is to develop a functional machine learning model for classifying mental health outcomes using structured datasets, with a focus on enhancing model interpretability and scalability for real-world mental health assessments.

Technical Methods:
Utilized Pandas and NumPy libraries for data preprocessing including MinMaxScaler normalization and Scikit-Learn's train-test splitting. Employed statistical methods like Spearman's rank correlation for feature exploration. Implemented and optimized a deep learning classification model using TensorFlow Keras, driven by GridSearchCV for hyperparameter optimization. Utilized decision tree models expressed using Graphviz and pydotplus for explainable decision boundaries. SHAP values were used to encourage explainable AI, revealing how each attribute would impact model prediction. K-means clustering was used to uncover underlying trends in the data to enhance the project's analytical depth.

Data Details:
The dataset contained 5,000 samples with 19 features related to mental health conditions, preprocessed to handle missing values, scale features, and ensure data integrity for consistent and reliable analysis.

Model Architecture:
Final architecture included a TensorFlow Keras deep learning model with multiple Dense layers optimized for classification tasks. To enhance interpretability, decision tree models were incorporated and visualized, while SHAP values provided transparent model explanations.
